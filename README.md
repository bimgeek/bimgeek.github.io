This repo contains the necessary files for publishing my website. [bimgeek.github.io](http://bimgeek.github.io) is my personal blog and portfolio and it is the website of [BIMGEEK Youtube ChannelðŸ”´](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLwgBbBfZLcqqbta10a_fpQ). I will share my blogs and store all the files I used in tutorials. You can access all the resources I have used in my videos.

This website as well as its base files will stay open source!
