      <description>Hello everyoneüëã,
I created a tutorial on placing objects randomly on a topography using Grasshopper inside Revit and created a forest model as an example case. The treeüå≥ family I&amp;rsquo;ve used is actually created by Gavin Crump. I gave him credit in the video as wellüòä. Please comment the topics you would like to see more content about. This tutorial is a great example to show how integrated Grasshopper and Revit are.</description>

      <description>Understanding and visualizing building data is essential to any data-driven workflow and being Speckle a data platform, it follows quite naturally that you might want to analyze streams and commits coming from it. And thats what we are going to do in this tutorial. I am going to show you how you can visualize Revit Room data in Power BI using Speckle connectors.

      <title>Revit Elements to Rhino Using Speckle</title>

      <description>In this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll send some Revit elements to Rhino and the geometry in Rhino will contain selected Revit parameters. This workflow contains a lot of use cases but I will create a really simple script that will color Revit elements by their properties, just to demonstrate the structure of the data that comes from Speckle and how we can use it in the workflow.

      <title>Create Revit Sheets from Excel</title>

      <description>In this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll create Revit Sheets from Excel table containing Sheet Names and Numbers with Dynamo. Especially in large scale projects, creating hundreds of sheets manually just doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense. Since we are already populating sheet names, numbers and any other data in Excel, why not use that data in Dynamo directly and automate this task. Let&amp;rsquo;s just do thatüëá!

      <title>Floor Finishes by Room using Grasshopper inside Revit</title>
      <link>https://bimgeek.github.io/tutorials/rir-floor-finish/</link>

      <description>In this video, we are going to automate floor finish creation using Grasshopper inside Revit. Creating floor finishes is a task that can be automated easily and save us a huge amount of time. When room finishes are defined or embedded in a room&amp;rsquo;s parameter, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense to model floor finishes manually. We are going to create floor finishes from room boundaries using Grasshopper inside Revit.</description>
