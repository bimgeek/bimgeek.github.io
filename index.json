And thats what we are going to do in this tutorial. I am going to show you how you can visualize Revit Room data in Power BI using Speckle connectors.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get started!🏃‍♂️\nPrefer watching than reading? Here\u0026rsquo;s a video too!

They take care of sending and receiving data in the host software to and from Speckle server.\nInstalling Revit Connector Installing the Revit connector is as simple as finding it in the list of available connectors in Speckle Manager and clicking “Install”.\nInstalling Power BI Connector Installing Power BI Connector is not as straightforward as other connector since it’s in Alpha. To install Power BI Speckle Connector:\n  Go to Speckle Power BI Repo\n  Go to the releases page and download the .mez file of the latest release.\n  Copy the downloaded file into the following folder: YOUR_USER_FOLDER\\Documents\\Power BI Desktop\\Custom Connectors\\ If the folder does not exist, create one and name it Custom Connectors.\n  After you copy the file, open Power BI.\n  Go to Settings -\u0026gt; Security -\u0026gt; Data Extensions and activate the (Not Recommended) Allow any extension to load without validation or warning option.\n  Now, restart Power BI and you should see Speckle (beta) appear in the data source.\n  Creating a Stream and Sending Data from Revit Let\u0026rsquo;s open the document and create a new stream. It just takes three steps:\n Go to Add-Ins and open Revit connector. Click the blue button on the bottom right corner. Use text box to name your stream and click the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; button to create a new stream.  There are couple ways to send data from Revit. We are going to send by category and select the Rooms.\n Click on the blue button in the middle of the card. Select the “Set/Edit Objects Filter”. Type in the category name and select it. Click on “Set Filter” option And finally double click on Send to send data straight away.  Voila! You have send your Revit rooms. When sending data from Revit, Speckle takes care of converting the data to a Speckle friendly format. Let’s view it in Speckleverse!\nReceiving in Power BI Let’s receive room data in Power BI.\n Click on Get Data and search for Speckle. Search for Speckle and select Speckle - Get stream by URL(Beta) Click Connect. Copy the Stream URL , paste it in the new screen and click OK.  Congrats, now you should see a screen that shows Speckle Objects as Records.\n\r#callout {\rbackground: #b3b3b33f;\rpadding: 1.5em 1.25em;\rborder-radius: 3px;\rdisplay: flex;\rflex-direction: row;\rmargin-bottom: 20px;\r}\r#callout-inner {\rmargin-left: 1em;\r}\r@media (max-width: 767px) {\r#callout {\rpadding: 1.5em 0.75em 1.5em 0.6em;\r}\r#callout-inner {\rmargin-left: 0.5em;\r}\r}\r\r📌\rPower BI connector supports only Streams and Branches at the time of this tutorial.\r\r Transforming Data in Power BI In order to create dashboards using the data received, it needs to be transformed into more readable format. Let’s do that!\n  Click on Transform data to access Power Query Editor\n  Received data includes blank rows at the moment. So we have to remove that first. From Remove Rows, select Remove Blank Rows.\n  We are not going to edit this table directly. So we are going to create a reference to that. Right click on table, select Reference. Lets rename this table as “Filtered Rooms” because we are going to filter only rooms from the received data.\n  Received data includes mesh geometry as well. So we have to filter the room objects. Lets add a custom column and get Speckle Types of objects using Record functions. Then filter only room objects.\n  Lets create a reference to Filtered Rooms table this time and rename it as Room Data.\n  To access parameters attribute of the records, simply click on the expand icon and select the attribute you want to expand. After you have the parameters record, expand it one more time to access the specific parameter records you want to access.\n  Now lets access the values of those parameters. Follow the steps mentioned above but select value attribute to get their values. Do this for all parameter columns.\n  Finally rename all columns into their parameter names such as “Room Area”, “Room Name” etc.\n  Now we are done tranforming lets close the Query Editor and apply any pending changes.\n  Congrats👏, you have imported your very first Speckle data into Power BI. You should be proud of yourself. Now you can create beautiful dashboards such as the one below👇.\nWatch the video above if you don’t know how to create Cards, Donut Charts and Slicers.

Details to that👇:\nElefront\nWombatGH\nCreating a Stream and sending data from Revit Let\u0026rsquo;s open the document and create a new stream. It just takes three steps:\n Go to Add-Ins and open Revit connector. Click the blue button on the bottom right corner. Use text box to name your stream and click the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; button to create a new stream.  There are couple ways to send data from Revit. But we are going to do it the manual way.\n Choose what you want to send by selecting it. Click on the blue button in the middle of the card. Select the \u0026ldquo;Set selection\u0026rdquo; option And finally double click on Send to send data straight away.  Receiving in Grasshopper Receiving data is also super easy: you just need the link! Copy the URL and paste it in a Panel. Then just plug it into a \u0026ldquo;Receive\u0026rdquo; component and click the \u0026ldquo;Receive\u0026rdquo; button. Voila, the stream is received!\nDefining Object Attributes Lets start by examining the received data. When we connect a panel to the data output, we can see that the output is a Base object. The base object class (actually called Base) is the foundation of all data being transferred with Speckle.\nExpand Speckle Object Let\u0026rsquo;s connect a Expand Speckle Object node to display the contents of that Base object. Using the object converter, expand node outputs the contents of the Base object. Selected elements will be listed by their Speckle types.\nIn this example, we can see that our elements are grouped under 8 lists. We\u0026rsquo;ll transfer Floors, Structural Columns, Structural Foundations, Structural Framing and Walls.\nFirst, we\u0026rsquo;ll use Merge node to merge these lists and then Expand it again to see the attributes of received objects.\nThis time Expand Speckle Object node will output the attributes of the selected objects. In this tutorial we will use following attributes:\n displayMesh: displayMesh contains the geometry of the element. It will be received as mesh geometry in Rhino. elementId: Revit Element Id of the selected element. We are going to use the value of it as the name of the geometry. type: Type name of the Revit element. An example is \u0026ldquo;Generic Concrete 300mm\u0026rdquo;. We will create a type attribute and set this as the value. speckle_type: Returns Speckle Type of the element. level: Level of the selected element. The value of this element will also be a Speckle Object and we only need the name of the level. So we will connect another expand Speckle object to get the parameter name.  Speckle Object Value by Key After we have the names of the attributes we are looking for, instead of connecting an Expand node, we can connect Speckle Object Value by Key node. This node expects an Object and a Key, and it returns the value of the given key.\nWe will connect the Merge result to the Object input of this node and connect the above parameters as the Key input.\nNow we have the keys and the values of the attributes, let\u0026rsquo;s create them. For that, we will use Define Object Attributes from Elefront.\n User Keys: This will be the merged list of the keys. In our case, type and level. User Values: Again, Merged list of the values of those keys. But be careful, you should graft the inputs to have two items in each list, one for the type and one for the level. Otherwise, you will end up with two lists. Name: The values of the elementId key. This will also be grafted. Layer: Layer will be the category of the elements. Also grafted. But first we have to define the layers. For that, we will use Define Layer node from Elefront to create Layers from unique names.  Do not forget to flatten the output depending on the structure of your lists.\nNow we created the attributes, let\u0026rsquo;s add them to the geometry. We will use Bake Objects from Elefront to bake mesh geometry with their corresponding attributes. Let\u0026rsquo;s give it a BakeName: \u0026ldquo;Revit to Rhino with Properties\u0026rdquo;. Bake input expects a Boolean so I will connect a Button to that. When I hit it, Boolean will turn True and it bakes the geometry.\nThis will be the final result.\nOther than geometry, we also have the information embedded in the model 🎉🎉\nColoring by Attributes In the previous part, we embedded the properties. There are potential use cases for it and we will demonstrate the first thing that comes to mind: Coloring them by their attributes in Rhino.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s do it💪!\nReferencing Geometry Lets start with referencing the geometry we baked. Since they are Mesh, we can use Reference by Type node and connect Mesh as the input.\nGet Attribute Values Now we have the geometry, let\u0026rsquo;s get the attribute values. We will use Get User Value and connect \u0026ldquo;type\u0026rdquo; string for the Key input. This will output Revit Type names as the output.\nCreate Color For Each Type Lets create a color for each unique types. We will convert our List to a Set to get unique items. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll use Random Color from WombatGH to create a color for each item connected.\nCreate Color For Each Element Lets match these colors with corresponding elements. We\u0026rsquo;ll use List Item to match the order of two lists and connect Map output of Set as the Index input of List Item.\nAdd Color to Geometry You\u0026rsquo;ve made it so far, congrats👏! Lets add colors to the geometry. First lets convert these colors to Elefront Attributes, then we have to modify the color attribute of the Rhino geometry and we will use Modify Rhino Attributes for that. Connect mesh geometry to the geometry input, Elefront attributes to the attributes input and a Boolean value of True to the modify input.\nColored by Type Attribute\nTa Da!🎊🎊🎊 You\u0026rsquo;ve made it. They are colored by their type attributes now! You can color it by any of its attributes. Try it yourselves. Below is colored by Level attribute instead of type.\nColored by Level Attribute\n Conclusion We hope you enjoyed this tutorial and found it useful!\nSpeckle is an Open Source project and we really ❤️ feedback, so if you have any questions, comments, critiques, or praises please let us know on our community forum.\n","permalink":"https://bimgeek.github.io/tutorials/revit-elements-to-rhino-using-speckle/","summary":"In this tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll send some Revit elements to Rhino and the geometry in Rhino will contain selected Revit parameters.

Just click on Add a Stream button or on the top left menu \u0026gt; Add stream \u0026gt; click on a stream to add to the document.\nBy default, streams are added as receivers but you can easily switch them to sender mode.\nTo send data from Excel, just select the range of data you want to send, click \u0026ldquo;Set range\u0026rdquo; and click on Send.\nYou can view your Excel data in Speckle server. This is how it will look like👇:\nReceiving Data in Dynamo Receiving data in Dynamo is very simple: You just need a Receive node, and a Stream URL as a string. When new data is pushed to this stream a notification will appear on the receive node.\nYour browser does not support the video tag. \r\r#callout {\rbackground: #b3b3b33f;\rpadding: 1.5em 1.25em;\rborder-radius: 3px;\rdisplay: flex;\rflex-direction: row;\rmargin-bottom: 20px;\r}\r#callout-inner {\rmargin-left: 1em;\r}\r@media (max-width: 767px) {\r#callout {\rpadding: 1.5em 0.75em 1.5em 0.6em;\r}\r#callout-inner {\rmargin-left: 0.5em;\r}\r}\r\r⚠️\rReceiving a commit and a stream are different. Make sure you copy the stream URL to have up-to-date data.\r\r Creating Revit Elements We received our Excel data in Dynamo. Congrats 🎉🎉! The next step will be manipulating this data and use it to create Revit elements. Lets do that🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️!\nFirst, we are going to Transpose this list. After that, we will use Get Item At Index node to get each list separately. Our first index will be 0 and second index will be 1. By doing so we separated our Sheet Names and Sheet Numbers from each other.\nNow is the exciting part. Lets create some Sheets 🚀! For this we are going to use Create Sheet node from Genius Loci. This node expects 3 inputs. Sheet names, Sheet numbers and Titleblock Type. We have our Sheet names and numbers as separate lists. We are going to use Titleblock Types node from Rhythm for the third input. Select the titleblock type and connect it to the last input.\nWhen we click on Run button, Voila🎊, list of sheets with appropriate names and numbers are created.

Çünkü halihazırda Autodesk👿 tarafından Revit\u0026rsquo;e dair yapılan geliştirmelerin ne kadar sınırlı olduğu ve bu kabiliyetlerin geliştirilmesi için hiç bir aksiyon almadıkları göz önüne alındığında, McNeel\u0026rsquo;in böyle bir projeye imza atması, McNeel\u0026rsquo;in kullanıcılar nezdindeki değerini (ve satışlarını) artıracağa benziyor.\n","permalink":"https://bimgeek.github.io/tutorials/rhino-inside-revit-nedir/","summary":"Grasshopper ile yapılmış mimari projelere bir örnek: Shanghai Tower, Gensler\nRhino ve Grasshopper Rhino🦏, McNeel tarafından geliştirilen bir 3D modelleme uygulaması ve 1980\u0026rsquo;de piyasaya sürülmesinden bu yana, güçlü geometri motoru💪 ve çok yönlülüğü nedeniyle mimari, imalat, endüstriyel tasarım ve ürün tasarımı için kullanılan önemli tasarım uygulamalarından biri haline gelmiştir.

For this reason, if I want to improve💪🏻 myself in a field, I surround myself with people who are interested🤔 in the same subject. It’s also really nice to be with people you speak the same language with.\nBIM4TURKEY Board Member\nBIM4TURKEY is a platform belonging to “Building Information Modeling and Management Association”. It aims to facilitate the integration of Building Information Modelling and Management (BIM) easier and smoother to the building industry, higher education and public companies.\nWe have founded it to create an atmosphere around the subject of BIM. Now, it has turned into an umbrella organization☂ rather than a platform. All the major construction companies (such as TURNER, Kalyon (my current company), BSI and many more) have partnered with us in achieving our mission💪🏻.\nSPECKLE Contributor\nSpeckle is a cloud based solution for the AEC industry that provides interoperability, real time collaboration, data management, versioning and automation. I am a firm believer in this project and try to contribute by reporting bugs, suggesting new features and creating tutorials that showcases how to use Speckle in our workflows.\nCO.DE:IST CO.DE:IST is a community of Computational Design enthusiasts in Istanbul. Our reason for establishing this community was to learn from each other and increase the knowledge in our country. We get together every two weeks and each week has its topic. That week’s speaker presents his work to the community. Presentation topics can be a solution brought by the speakers in their workflow processes via Dynamo, Grasshopper or Revit API. We have learned a lot from each other since this community was formed.\nOSArch Community The Open-Source Architecture Community brings together like-minded users and developers who share a common goal: that the built environment can be designed, constructed, operated, and recycled with free/libre and open-source software, with increased transparency, and a more ethical approach.\nI have been involved with the OSArch community for about a year now. I have been creating graphic designs🖼 for meetups and operating the OSArch Youtube Channel🔴.\n","permalink":"https://bimgeek.github.io/cv/","summary":"Mücahit Bilal GÖKER Summary ✍  I am an architect with experience in a wide variety of project scales and types, worked with designers, engineers and contractors in all phases of building design and construction.
